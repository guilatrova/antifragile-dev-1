# 🧑‍💻 The Antifragile Dev #1

Inspired by this [blog post](https://blog.guilatrova.dev/formal-education-is-dead/) we're going to build a microservice architecture in public.

## 🗺️ The project

It's a directory list of restaurants (inspired by [nomadlist.com](https://nomadlist.com/)).

- We should extract initial data from Google Maps based on cities (so it starts with some/any content)
- It should be able to sync data from Google Maps to your site
- We should customize it to allow adding more customizations, like:
  - People from your site can rank the restaurants
  - People from your site can tag restaurants with new categories (e.g. Good wi-fi, Calm place, etc)

How to make all of these bullet points above happen, is totally open to you, and there's no "wrong" or "good" implementation. The goal is to make it work by any means.

Also, feel free to enrich and customize this template. Make it yours. ❤️
